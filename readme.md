This is a simple setup with some basic configs and prebuild binaries.

Go check them out at:
Helix: https://helix-editor.com/
Lazygit: https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit

Both applications should be added to your user paths
Additionally, this repository should live in %user%/appdata/roaming/ on windows for the .toml files to be active.
Either clone it there or manually paste the .toml files in %user%/appdata/roaming/helix/

For further lsp options, these might be added here, linked up online or require installs on the system.
All helix requires is the PATH to be setup correctly.
